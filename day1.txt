Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
•	Understanding what Machine Learning is
•	Why Machine Learning is needed
•	Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement (overview)
•	Basic ML workflow (problem → data → model → prediction)
•	Task 1: Write a simple definition of ML in your own words
•	Task 2: Identify one real-life problem that can be solved using ML
•	Task 3: Define the problem statement, input data, and expected output for that problem


🚀 Machine Learning Roadmap – Day 1 Completed

Today I started my journey into Machine Learning and learned the fundamentals.

📌 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a method where computers learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

📌 Real-Life Problem I Chose

Student Performance Prediction
The goal is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their academic and background data. This can help teachers identify students who need early support.

📌 Problem Statement

To predict whether a student will pass the course using their study habits and academic information.

📌 Input Data (Features):

Study Hours per Week

Attendance Rate

Previous Grades

Participation in Extracurricular Activities (Yes/No)

Parent Education Level

Student ID (only for identification)

📌 Expected Output:

Passed → Yes / No

This is a classification problem because the output is categorical.
