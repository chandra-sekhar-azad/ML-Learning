# Day 2 – Dataset Collection & Understanding

## Project: Student Performance Prediction (Pass/Fail)

This project aims to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on academic and background features using Machine Learning.

---

## Task 1: Dataset Selection

I searched and selected a **student-related dataset in CSV format** aligned with my problem statement.  
The dataset contains student academic and background information suitable for predicting exam outcomes.

## Task 2: Features and Target Column

### Features (Input Variables)

| Feature | Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Study Hours per Week | Numeric | Average study time per week |
| Attendance Rate | Numeric (%) | Percentage of classes attended |
| Previous Grades | Numeric | Past academic score |
| Participation in Extracurricular Activities | Categorical | Yes / No |
| Parent Education Level | Categorical / Ordinal | High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD |
| Student ID | Identifier | Used only for identification (not for prediction) |

### Target Variable (Output)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Passed | Binary | Yes = Pass, No = Fail |

This is a **Binary Classification problem**.

## Task 3: Dataset Observations

- Each row represents **one student**
- Dataset contains both:
  - **Numerical data** (study hours, attendance, grades)
  - **Categorical data** (Yes/No, education levels)

### Possible Data Issues Identified
- Some study hours may contain **invalid values** (e.g., negative)
- Some attendance rates may exceed **100%**
- Some grades may be outside the expected range
- Categorical features will require **encoding** before model training

These issues highlight the importance of **data cleaning and preprocessing** before applying Machine Learning algorithms.
